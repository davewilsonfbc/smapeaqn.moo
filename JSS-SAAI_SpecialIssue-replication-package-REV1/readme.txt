This folder supports the evaluation that has been conducted for the work submitted to JSS Special Issue on Software Architecture and Artificial Intelligence, **after the first revision**. In particular:   - SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg contains the SMAPEA QN for the considered case study, as an xmi representation conforming to JSimGraph from JMT.    [Note: A backup file is also provided, see -bkp suffix.]  - res_sim_SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsim is a temporary file used by JMT engine to store simulation results.  - The subfolders corresponding to the custom NSGA-II executions devised for the experimentation are named as: >   09_00625_ps_ne_timeout60_Xsamplesec    where: 	- 09 denotes a crossover probability of 90% (fixed)	- 00625 denotes a mutation probability of 6.25% (fixed)	- ps denotes population size	- ne denotes number of evaluations	- timeout60 denotes a 60-seconds timeout (fixed)	- Xsamplesecs denotes the workload intensity, i.e. the mean of the deterministic workload distribution det(x)  - JSS_SAAI_SpecialIssue_Experiment_V1.xlsx contains all the experimental results as an Excel spreadsheet.EXPERIMENT REPLICATIONTo replicate the experiment, please follow these steps:  1. Checkout the project on GitHub, import the project into the Eclipse workspace and the related Maven dependencies.  2. Create a folder named experiment in the main project folder  3. Copy the file SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg into experiment folder  4. Create a new Run configuration with:    a) Main Class: it.univaq.disim.seagroup.smapeaqn.moo.runners.CspNSGAIIRunner    b) Program arguments: ./experiments/SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg 3 3 0.9 0.0625 ps ne, i.e.:        3 system modes (namely Normal, Alert, Critical), 3 controllers, 90% and 6.25% as crossover and mutation probabilities, ps and ne as population size and        number of evaluations, respectively.  5. Set the desired workload intensity by choosing one of the options below:     a) Open SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg file with JSimGraph, go to "Define customer classes" and then edit the Interarrival Time Distribution for        Sense class by providing a mean value, e.g. 0.5.    b) Open SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg file through a text/XML editor and provide a workload intensity inside the tag <value> of subparameter "t"        within "distrParam" (please find those tags at lines 30-32 circa), e.g. <value>0.5</value>.  6. Run the configuration created at point 4     [Note: To save space, after performance evaluation of a solution, the corresponding .jsimg file is deleted from the file system. To maintain the       generated SMAPEA QN models, the call to deleteModelFiles method within CspSimpleNSGAIIRunner class.]  7. Further simulation of each solution returned by the custom NSGA-II should be performed, in order to evaluate the impact of SMAPEA QNs simulation confidence interval, i.e. 90%. To this aim:     a) Create a new Run configuration with it.univaq.disim.seagroup.smapeaqn.moo.util.FurtherSimulationManager as Main Class	b) Make sure that the main method of such a Main Class properly calls the constructor as follows:> 	FurtherSimulationManager further_sim_mgr = new FurtherSimulationManager("./experiments/further_simulations/", "further_simulations_input_Xsampleseccsv", "further_simulations_output_Xsamplesec.csv", "SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg");      where: 	- The first parameter refers to the folder dedicated to further simulations.	- The second parameter refers to a .csv file that must be provided as input to the Main Class, containing the union of all the solutions returned by the custom NSGA-II for workload intensity X.   **[NOTE: This is a manual step. Please refer to the input .csv files within *further_simulations* folder.]**	- The third parameter refers to a .csv file returned by the Main Class, containing ...	- The last parameter refers to the SMAPEA QN under consideration, that will be parameterized based on the input .csv file and further simulated.	c) Run the configuration defined in the previous step and obtain the output .csv file whic can be used for efficiency analysis.
