This folder contains the results of the experimentation that we have conducted for the work in ECSA 2020, as well as the artifacts needed to replicate the experiment. In particular:   - SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg contains the SMAPEA QN for the considered case study, as an xmi representation conforming to JSimGraph from JMT (http://jmt.sourceforge.net/Papers/JMT_users_Manual.pdf). [Note: A backup file is also provided, corresponding to the “-bkp” suffix.]  - Subfolders contain the results of genetic algorithm executions, modulo the considered workload intensities. - res_sim_SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsim is a temporary file used to store simulation results.- ECSA2020-experiment.xlsx contains all the experimental results as an Excel spreadsheet. EXPERIMENT REPLICATIONTo replicate (part of) the experiment, please follow these steps:1. Checkout the project on GitHub, import the project into the Eclipse workspace and the related Maven dependencies.2. Create a folder “experiment” in the main project folder3. Copy the file SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg into “experiment” folder4. Crete a new Run configuration with:  a) Main Class: it.univaq.disim.seagroup.smapeaqn.moo.runners.CspNSGAIIRunner  b) Program arguments: ./experiments/SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg 2 3 0.9 0.0625 pop numevals. i.e.: 2 system modes, 3 controllers, 0.9 and 0.0625 as crossover and mutation probabilities, pop and numevals denoting population size and number of evaluations, respectively.
5. Run [Note: To save space, after performance evaluation of a solution, the corresponding .jsimg file is deleted from the file system. To maintain the generated SMAPEA QN models, the call to "deleteModelFiles" method within CspSimpleNSGAIIRunner class.]
