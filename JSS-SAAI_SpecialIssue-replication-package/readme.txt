This folder contains the results of the experimentation that I have conducted for the JSS Special Issue on Software Architecture and Artificial Intelligence, as well as the artifacts needed to replicate the experiment. In particular:   - SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg contains the SMAPEA QN for the considered case study,     as an xmi representation conforming to JSimGraph from JMT.    [Note: A backup file is also provided, corresponding to the -bkp suffix.]  - The subfolder contains the results of genetic algorithm executions of Phase 1 and 2.   - res_sim_SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsim is a temporary file used to store simulation results.  - JSS_SAAI_SpecialIssue_Experiment.xlsx contains all the experimental results as an Excel spreadsheet. EXPERIMENT REPLICATIONTo replicate the experiment, please follow these steps:  1. Checkout the project on GitHub, import the project into the Eclipse workspace and the related Maven dependencies.  2. Create a folder named experiment in the main project folder  3. Copy the file SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg into experiment folder  4. Crete a new Run configuration with:    a) Main Class: it.univaq.disim.seagroup.smapeaqn.moo.runners.CspNSGAIIRunner    b) Program arguments: ./experiments/SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg 2 3 0.9 0.0625 pop numevals, i.e.:        2 system modes, 3 controllers, 0.9 and 0.0625 as crossover and mutation probabilities,        pop and numevals denoting population size and number of evaluations, respectively.
  5. Set the desired workload intensity by choosing one of the options below: 
    a) Open SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg file with JSimGraph, go to "Define customer classes" and then edit the Interarrival Time Distribution for 
          Sense class by providing a mean value, e.g. 0.5.
    b) Open SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg file through a text/XML editor and provide a workload intensity inside the tag <value> of subparameter "t" 
          within "distrParam" (please find those tags at lines 30-32 circa), e.g. <value>0.5</value>.
  6. Run the configuration created at point 4 [Note: To save space, after performance evaluation of a solution, the corresponding .jsimg file is deleted          from the file system. To maintain the generated SMAPEA QN models, the call to deleteModelFiles method within CspSimpleNSGAIIRunner class.]
