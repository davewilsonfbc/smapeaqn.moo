This folder contains the results of the experimentation that we have conducted for Communications in Computer and Information Science series, as well as the artifacts needed to replicate the experiment. In particular:   - SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg contains the SMAPEA QN for the considered case study,     as an xmi representation conforming to JSimGraph from JMT.    [Note: A backup file is also provided, corresponding to the -bkp suffix.]  - res_sim_SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsim is a temporary file used to store simulation results.  - ECSA2020-experiment.xlsx contains all the experimental results as an Excel spreadsheet. EXPERIMENT REPLICATIONTo obtain a hybrid.diversity Controller Selection Policy, please follow these steps:  1. Checkout the project on GitHub, import the project into the Eclipse workspace and the related Maven dependencies.  2. Create a folder named experiment in the main project folder  3. Copy the file SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg into experiment folder  4. Crete a new Run configuration with:    a) Main Class: it.univaq.disim.seagroup.smapeaqn.moo.runners.CspNSGAIIRunner    b) Program arguments: ./experiments/SMAPEA-QN-emergency-handling.jsimg 2 3 0.9 0.0625 pop numevals, i.e.:        2 system modes, 3 controllers, 0.9 and 0.0625 as crossover and mutation probabilities,        pop and numevals denoting population size and number of evaluations, respectively.
       [Note: The hybrid.diversity Controller Selection Policy referred throughout the paper has been obtained with pop=1440 and evals=1440.]
  5. Run
     [Note: To save space, after performance evaluation of a solution, the corresponding .jsimg file is deleted from the file system, and only two textual files are maintained into an ad-hoc folder, describing the near-optimal solutions returned by the genetic algorithm and the corresponding fitness function values, respectively. To maintain the generated SMAPEA QN models the call to deleteModelFiles method within CspSimpleNSGAIIRunner class.]
